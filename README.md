# pomodoro_app

### This is an app that will help its users to follow the Pomodoro technique (the 25-minutes rule) so that they can better focus on their tasks.

(In Pomodoro technique, the follower has to work for 25 mins and then rest for 5 mins, then again work for 25 mins and rest for 5 mins and the cycle goes until 3 hours.)

- Learnt about Timer function and how data is passed from one function to another.
- Got a more better sense of UI and widgets and how to use progress-bars.

### Here are some of the screenshots of the app:
